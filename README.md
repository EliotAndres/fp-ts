# Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install fp-ts
```

Make sure to always have a single version of `fp-ts` installed in your project. Multiple versions are known to cause `tsc` to hang during compilation. You can check the versions currently installed using `npm ls fp-ts` (make sure there's a single version and all the others are marked as `deduped`).

## TypeScript compatibility

**Strictness** â€“ This library is conceived, tested and is supposed to be consumed by TypeScript with the `strict` flag turned on.

| `fp-ts` version | required `typescript` version |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2.0.x+          | 3.5+                          |
| 1.15.x+         | 3.1+                          |
| <= 1.14.4       | 2.8+ (\*)                     |

(\*) If you are running `< typescript@3.0.1` you have to polyfill the `unknown` type. You can use [unknown-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/unknown-ts) as a polyfill.
